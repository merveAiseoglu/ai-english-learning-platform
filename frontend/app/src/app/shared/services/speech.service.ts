 * Speech Service (Shared)

 * Note: There are multiple speech-related services in the project:
 * - audio-recording.service.ts - Handles microphone recording
 * - text-to-speech.service.ts - Handles text-to-speech conversion
 * - speech.service.ts (this file) - Purpose unclear, may be redundant
 * 
 * Consider consolidating speech-related services or clearly defining this service's purpose
